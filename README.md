# OpenCV vehicle and speed detection

This software program detects vehicles on german Autobahn and calculates the current speed. It also counts the number of vehicles, which drove through a ROI (Region of interest) and takes pictures of them to save on disk.

The project was developed for a study project at Technische Hochschule Köln (University of applied science Cologne) in the study programme Master computer engineering.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Prerequisited elements:

* Python 3
* OpenCV 3.4.5 library for python 3
* [Origin video file](https://youtu.be/IIGQQhLvqdY)


### Installing

```
python3 main.py
```
